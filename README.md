Introduction and Motivation
==================================
As the Korean population ages, the prevalence of depression in Korean elderly is increasing. According to the 'Survey on Elderly Conditions' published by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs in 2018, 21.1% of 65-year-olds were found to have depressive symptoms, and 6.7% answered that they had considered suicide. Also, 13.2% of the elderly who had contemplated suicide had also attempted suicide. Even though depression in the most common psychiatric disorder in the elderly, it is often underreported, underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated. Prior research highlight that subjective self-rated depression surveys such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) are not robust measures of the severity of depression in patients.  Furthermore, frequently, elders underreport depressive symptoms, possibly due to shame or a lack of understanding of depression, further reducing the validity of these questionnaire as a true indicator of depression.

Instead, we aim to develop a supervised classification model based on objective predictor variables to classify elders into depressed or not. One of the dominant explanation for depression in elderly is morbidity. In addition, loneliness, loss of a valued role and independence, being female, bereavement, alcohol consumption, and smoking are some risk factors for depression in Elders. As the KNAHES 2019 dataset includes a plethora of health and socioeconomic variables, we developed logistic, decision tree, random forest classifiers using these objective predictor variable to classify elders to depressed or not. Such models can be incorporated into the healthcare system to support preliminary identification of patients with a risk of depression. Prior intervention studies demonstrated that education, consultation, increased exposure to communal activity positively impacted depressed elders, whilst case management programs reduced suicidal thoughts. As such, through early identification and treatment of depressed elderly patients based on our supervised learning models, we hope to prevent elderly suicide.
